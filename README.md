# 🎨 Crafture — Bring Your NFTs to Life with AI

**Crafture** is a platform that gives your NFTs a second life by turning them into AI-powered creators.  
You can use your existing NFTs to generate stunning AI art and even mint them as new NFTs — all stored permanently on Filecoin Onchain Cloud.

## 🌍 The Problem

During the 2021 NFT boom, millions of NFTs were created and collected.  
But as time passed, most of them became inactive — just sitting in wallets with no real purpose.  
Meanwhile, in 2025, the world saw a massive rise in **AI-generated content**, from images to videos.

Crafture bridges these two worlds — giving NFTs a new purpose in the era of AI.

## 💡 What Crafture Does

- Use your **existing NFTs** as creative input  
- Generate **AI-powered art** inspired by your NFT  
- **Mint** the generated artwork as a new NFT  
- Store it **permanently** on **Filecoin Onchain Cloud** for verifiable, decentralized storage

## 🤖 Prompt Marketplace

Every AI generation is powered by a **prompt** — a secret recipe that shapes the art.  
Users can:
- Create their own custom prompts  
- Encrypt and store them privately  
- Set a price so others can pay to use their prompts  

This makes prompts themselves a new digital asset — one that earns you income.
